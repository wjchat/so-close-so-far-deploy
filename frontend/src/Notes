Changes as of 4/22/20
--------------------------------

    + Other possible option is commented out in global SCSS
+ X Animation complete
+ Loading screen "enter" font changed
+ Edited upload error messages to be one line

Outstanding Issues (Not saying you gotta do all this yourself, just thought it'd be helpful to keep track)
---------------------------------
+ Email input highlight
+ Video starts again after pausing when you first load in
    + This has to do with the function in place to handle pausing when video player is clicked
    + React-Player could be an easy solution to this
+ Copy finalization
+ Body typeface finalization 
+ Resizing
+ Mobile 


Extras 
---------------
+ If adobe fonts dont work initially try pasting this into either the html head or layout head
    + <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.typekit.net/fck3ywu.css"/>
+ Reccommend to Yago to start video with heavy black
+ Reccommend to Yago to not end video with full black screen to avoid page looking empty
